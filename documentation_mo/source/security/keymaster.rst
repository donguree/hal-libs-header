Overview
********

General Description
===================

| Secure Storage is a function commonly required by the connected embedded system and is also adopted by its products as a prerequisite for mass production.

| webOS provides several means for data protection, and KeyManager is provided to protect encryption keys that require the highest level of security.

| The keymaster in this requirement has the same requirement as the Android HW keymaster.

| The keymaster protects key data by generating and protecting key data in the TEE and encrypting it with the master key generated in the TEE.

| The keymaster TA receives and processes requests for encryption, decryption, and key generation through the keymaster CA library.

| Keymaster CA library should be installed to /usr/lib the file name libopteeKeymasterCA.so


Features
========

| The keymaster must support key generation. Create a key by referring to the requested information, encrypt it with the master key generated by the keymaster, and return it.

| The keymaster supports the creation of the keys below.

- 1. AES-128, AES-192, AES-256
- 2. RSA-1024, RSA-2048, RSA-3072, RSA-4096
- 3. EC-224, EC-256, EC-384, EC-521
- 4. HMAC-192

| The keymaster allows the import of externally generated keys.

- 1. AES-128, AES-192, AES-256
- 2. RSA-1024, RSA-2048, RSA-3072, RSA-4096
- 3. EC-224, EC-256, EC-384, EC-521
- 4. HMAC-192

| The keymaster should support the following operations using keys generated or imported through the keymaster.

- 1. Encryption
- 2. Decryption
- 3. Sign
- 4. Verify

Architecture
============

Driver Architecture
-------------------

.. image:: resource/keymaster_arch.PNG

| Keymaster3 is a service that receives requests from the App and performs key generation, key management, and cryptographic algorithm tasks using Keymaster TA operating within the TEE.

| Keymaster CA is responsible for converting and delivering input data so that the functions provided by Keymaster TA are accessible.

| The keymaster TA is an application that operates in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) and generates the requested key, Perform key management and cryptographic algorithm tasks Key generation and encryption algorithm operations are implemented using the Global Platform TEE Internal Core API.

| Sestore TA is an application that operates on the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), encrypts the user's key using the key of the TEE, stores it securely, and returns the key plain text on request.


Overall Workflow
================

Steps Before Provisioning Key
-------------------
.. image:: resource/keymaster_overall.PNG

| The keymanager3 service will call keymaster api which is provided by keymaster CA library.

| The keymaster TA operates on TEE and aims to protect key data.

| The keymaster TA protects key data and properties by making them key blob and encrypting them with the keymaster TA's master key.

| The key data generated by the keymaster TA is not exposed to REE as a plain data.

| The keymaster TA should perform the crypto operation delivered through the keymaster CA. If there is HW supported crypto operation, it should be used to improve performance.

================================= ======================================

Quality and Constraints
=======================

Exception Cases
-----------

| If there are more than 20 hands, delete the oldest hands first.

| keymaster TA's master key must not be deleted or changed after it has been created.

Implementation
**************

File Location
=============
| The keymaster api for crypto operations is provided by libopteeKeymasterCA library.
| libopteeKeymasterCA.so should be installed when hal-libs is built. 
| And keymaster code can be stored in hal-libs repo.
